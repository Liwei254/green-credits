# Deployments Directory

This directory contains deployment artifacts generated by the deployment scripts.

## Files

- `moonbeam.json` - Moonbeam Alpha (testnet) deployment addresses and minimal ABIs
- Other network deployment files may be added here

## Usage

After running the deployment script:

```bash
cd blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-moonbeam.ts --network moonbeamAlpha
```

The script will generate `moonbeam.json` with the deployed contract addresses and minimal ABIs.

## Structure

Each deployment file contains:
- Network information (chainId, timestamp)
- Deployer address
- Contract addresses
- Minimal ABI fragments for frontend use

## Important

- These files are generated automatically
- Do not manually edit unless you know what you're doing
- Update frontend `.env` file with addresses from these files
