## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Due to Environment)

### Manual Verification Recommended
- [ ] Compile contracts locally: `npx hardhat compile`
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Deploy to Moonbase testnet
- [ ] Test UI flows in browser
- [ ] Verify TimelockController integration
- [ ] Test EXIF stripping on real images
