# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 3 introduces governance, reputation management, quadratic funding, enhanced privacy, and improved accountability to the Green Credits dApp. This document summarizes all changes made.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. VerifierBadgeSBT.sol
**Purpose**: Soulbound NFT badges for verifiers with reputation tracking

**Key Features**:
- ERC-721 based soulbound tokens (non-transferable)
- One badge per address (enforced by `tokenOfOwner` mapping)
- Badge levels (1-10) stored in `levelOf` mapping
- Reputation tracking via `reputationOf` mapping (int256, can be positive or negative)
- Owner-only functions: `mint`, `revoke`, `increaseReputation`, `decreaseReputation`
- Overridden transfer functions to prevent transfers (revert with "Soulbound" message)
- Approval functions disabled

**Events**:
- `BadgeMinted(address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint8 level)`
- `BadgeRevoked(uint256 indexed tokenId)`
- `ReputationIncreased(address indexed verifier, int256 amount, int256 newTotal)`
- `ReputationDecreased(address indexed verifier, int256 amount, int256 newTotal)`

### 2. MatchingPoolQuadratic.sol
**Purpose**: Quadratic funding mechanism for community/project donations

**Key Features**:
- Rounds with configurable start/end times and matching budgets
- Project registration per round (projectId -> address mapping)
- Direct donation tracking (donor -> projectId -> amount)
- Total contributions per project tracking
- Admin-submitted match allocations (calculated off-chain using quadratic formula)
- Finalization disburses both direct donations and matching funds
- Round finalization status tracking to prevent double-disbursement

**Structs**:
```solidity
struct Round {
    uint256 id;
    address token;
    uint256 start;
    uint256 end;
    uint256 matchingBudget;
    bool active;
}
```

**Key Functions**:
- `createRound`: Create a new funding round
- `activateRound` / `deactivateRound`: Toggle round state
- `addProject`: Register projects to receive donations
- `donate`: Donate GCT tokens to a project in an active round
- `setMatchAllocations`: Admin submits calculated matches and disburses funds
- `getRound`, `getContribution`: View functions

**Events**:
- `RoundCreated`, `RoundActivated`, `RoundDeactivated`
- `ProjectAdded`, `Donation`, `MatchAllocated`, `RoundFinalized`

### 3. EcoActionVerifier.sol Updates
**Changes**:
- Added `mapping(uint256 => address) public verifierOfAction` to track which verifier verified each action
- Added `event VerifierRecorded(uint256 indexed actionId, address indexed verifier)`
- Updated `verifyAction` function to record `msg.sender` as the verifier and emit `VerifierRecorded` event

**Purpose**: Enable accountability and link verifier reputation to specific actions

## Deployment Script

**Purpose**: Deploy Phase 3 contracts and optionally setup TimelockController governance

**Features**:
- Deploys `VerifierBadgeSBT` and `MatchingPoolQuadratic`

**Test Count**: 13 tests across 4 describe blocks

### 2. MatchingPoolQuadratic.test.js
**Coverage**:
- Round creation (success, invalid parameters, non-owner rejection)
- Round management (activate, deactivate, add projects, duplicate project prevention)
- Donations (accept donations, track multiple donations, prevent inactive round donations, prevent invalid project donations)
- Match allocation (finalize rounds, reject allocations exceeding budget, prevent finalization before end, prevent double finalization)

**Test Count**: 16 tests across 4 describe blocks

### 3. EcoActionVerifierPhase3.test.js
**Coverage**:
- Verifier tracking (record verifier on verification, emit VerifierRecorded event)

**Test Count**: 4 tests across 2 describe blocks

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
**New Sections**:
- Phase 3 deployment instructions with environment variable documentation
- Key features overview (verifier reputation, quadratic funding, privacy, retirement, governance)
- Usage flows for each Phase 3 feature:
  - Mint verifier badges
  - Create funding rounds
  - Donate to projects
  - Finalize rounds
  - Retire credits
  - Attach attestations
- Updated frontend environment variables list
- Updated test coverage description

### .env.example (frontend)
**Added Variables**:
- `VITE_VERIFIER_BADGE_SBT_ADDRESS`
- `VITE_MATCHING_POOL_ADDRESS`

## Architecture Highlights

### Governance via TimelockController
- Uses OpenZeppelin's battle-tested `TimelockController`
- Supports role-based access (proposers, executors, admin)
- Configurable delay (e.g., 1-7 days) before execution
- Ownership transfer is optional (enable via env variables)
- All Phase 1, 2, and 3 contracts can be governed by timelock

### Privacy Enhancements
- Client-side EXIF stripping prevents location/PII leaks
- Perceptual hashing enables duplicate detection without storing images
- User consent via explicit toggle (default: strip EXIF)
- Works with any image type (converts to JPEG)

### Quadratic Funding Design
- Off-chain calculation to avoid heavy on-chain sqrt operations
- Admin submits pre-calculated allocations (gas-efficient)
- Future work: ZK proofs to verify allocations
- Supports multiple concurrent rounds
- Project allowlist per round for quality control

### Verifier Accountability
- On-chain record of who verified each action
- Reputation system enables slashing/rewards based on performance
- Soulbound badges create verifiable credentials
- Challenge system (Phase 2) can tie to reputation adjustments

## Security Considerations

### Soulbound Tokens
- ✅ Transfers disabled via `_update` override
- ✅ Approvals disabled (reverts with clear message)
- ✅ One badge per address enforced
- ✅ Only owner can mint/revoke

### Matching Pool
- ✅ Only active rounds accept donations
- ✅ Time-based restrictions (start/end)
- ✅ Budget cap enforced (cannot exceed matching budget)
- ✅ Double-finalization prevented
- ✅ Project allowlist per round
- ⚠️ Trust assumption: Admin calculates QF formula honestly (future: ZK proofs)

### Timelock
- ✅ Uses OpenZeppelin's audited implementation
- ✅ Configurable delay provides time for community review
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ⚠️ Ensure deployer renounces admin role after setup

### EXIF Stripping
- ✅ Runs client-side (no server trust required)
- ✅ User can toggle (transparency)
- ⚠️ Canvas API may not preserve all image formats perfectly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Subgraph/Indexer**: Index badge mints, reputation changes, donations for efficient querying
2. **ZK Proofs**: Verify QF allocations on-chain without heavy computation
3. **Automated Reputation**: Tie reputation to challenge outcomes automatically
4. **Multi-token Support**: Allow matching pools for different tokens
5. **Donation Matching Limits**: Per-donor caps for fairer distribution
6. **Badge Levels**: Auto-adjust based on verification count/quality
7. **UI Improvements**: Visual reputation scores, badge gallery, donation analytics

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully extends the Green Credits dApp with:
- **Trust layer**: Verifier reputation and badges
- **Funding mechanism**: Quadratic matching for impact projects
- **Privacy**: EXIF stripping and perceptual hashing
- **Governance**: Optional TimelockController for decentralized control
