# TODO: Implement Mobile-First Responsive UX & Wallet Recommendations

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update `frontend/src/App.tsx` to make header padding responsive (reduce on mobile).
- [x] Enhance `frontend/src/components/Walkthrough.tsx` to include mobile wallet recommendations (MetaMask Mobile, WalletConnect, Trust Wallet) and FAQs.
- [x] Review other components (e.g., Donate.tsx) for missing responsive classes and add if necessary.
- [x] Test the app in mobile view to ensure responsiveness (app running on http://localhost:5175).
- [ ] Verify wallet connection flow on mobile devices.
